RxUptime - OS/2 Warp REXX extension DLL for getting system uptime
           information from DosQuerySysInfo() and
           DosTmrQueryFreq()/DosTmrQueryTime().

Written by: Mike Ruskai <thannymeister@yahoo.com>

This REXX extension DLL is released into the public domain.  Use at your
own risk.

Functions:

RxLoadUptime - Load all uptime functions.

RxDropUptime - Drop all uptime functions.

RxMSCount    - Query running millisecond count via DosQuerySysInfo().
               Returns the number of milliseconds, or -1 if there was an
               error during execution.

RxTmrFreq    - Query CPU timer frequency via DosTmrQueryFreq().
               Returns the number of Hertz, or -1 if there was an error.

RxTmrTime    - Query CPU timer count via DosTmrQueryTime().
               Returns the number of cycles, or -1 if there was an error.

All functions take no arguments.  I seem to recall reading somewhere that
the DosTmr*() API's were added with Warp 4, so functionality under Warp 3
is indeterminate.

See the included uptime.cmd for an example.

The source and module definition file are included, and may be modified and
redistributed under another package name.  No derivative of the code may
be sold.
